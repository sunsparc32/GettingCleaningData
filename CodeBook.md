All accelerations are in units of "g", which is about 9.8 m/s^2. This means that an acceleation vale of 0.25 corresponds to 0.25g = 0.25*9.8 = 2.45m/s^2. The gyro units are in radnains/s. The first column shows the subject code while the second column shows the activity that was undertaken.

Please note that each column from 3 to 81 denotes the mean of that quantity for that particular subject and activity. Hence the tidy set contains means of means (e.g., column 3, "tBodyAccMeanX") and means of standard deviations (e.g., column 6, "tBodyAccStdX").

When a variable name starts with a "t", it denotes a variable in the time domain. A variable names that starts with an "f" denotes a variable in the frequency domain.

The following are the column names (headers) in tidy_data_set.txt:
